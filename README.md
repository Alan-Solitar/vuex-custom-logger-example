# vuex-custom-logger-example
An example of a custom logger setup for the included vuex logger plugin.

Take a look at the logger-config file if you are just interested in seeing the full logger code.

If you want to see the logger in action, I have included the full "examples" application included with in the official vuex repo.

To run that application, enter the examples directory and run `npm run dev`.

Then go to localhost:8080 and click on the shopping cart application.

When you commit a mutation, you should see the custom logs in your console.
